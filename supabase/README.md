# Supabase Backend Implementation

This document provides a quick reference and implementation guide for using Supabase as the backend database solution.

## Database Schema

The database schema is defined in the `migrations` folder. The initial schema includes tables for projects, tasks, users, and comments, with appropriate relationships and constraints.
Refer to `migrations/001_initial_schema.sql` for complete SQL definitions.

## Supabase Dashboard

You can manage the database through Supabase dashboard <https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/YOUR_PROJECT_REF/>

## API Endpoints

The API endpoints for interacting with the database are auto-generated by Supabase. You can find the API documentation in the Supabase dashboard under the "API" section.
